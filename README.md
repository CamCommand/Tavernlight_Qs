Interview answers

The interview questions had more Lua than I expected from the application that said "...Lua was a big plus to have.". I picked it up where I could and am happy with the answers I gave.
I was unable to start the forgottenserver as I ran into an error seen in "Error.png". I thought that I could spend hours to days trying to get onto it and program Q5-7 in an engine I had no experience in,
or I could cut my losses and recreate the videos in something I know I could do.
Therefore, during recreating the last three questions, I identified the methods used in the video and programmed their base functionality in vb.net. I believe this was a better choice than simply giving up.
